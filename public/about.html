<h1>About Done</h1>

<p>Done is an opinionated productivity application inspired by the <a href="/done-manifesto.html">Cult of Done
    Manifesto</a>. It
    embraces the philosophy of getting
    things done quickly and moving forward, rather than getting stuck solving a problem that does not want to be fixed.
</p>

<h2>How to Use Done</h2>

<p>Done categorizes your tasks into four states:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Not Knowing:</strong> The Created State
    </li>

    <li><strong>Action:</strong> Tasks you're currently working on. They appear at the top because they are most
        important.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Done:</strong> Completed tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Destroyed:</strong> Tasks that are no longer relevant or have been abandoned.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you create a task, it goes into the <strong>Not Knowing</strong> category. The timer starts, giving you 2
    weeks to get the task done. If 2 weeks is not enough, try breaking the task into smaller pieces.</p>
<p>To update a task's status, just click the button corresponding to where you need to move it. An
    <strong>Action</strong> can be changed to a <strong>Done</strong> or <strong>Destroyed</strong> task. And <strong>Not
        Knowing</strong> to all 3. Once a task is <strong>Done</strong> or <strong>Destroyed</strong> there is no where
    else for it to go.
    <br>ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ Once a task moved, it can not be moved back.ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨</p>
<p>It's your app, if you want to take another shot at a destroyed task, go for it!
    But, to use <strong>Done</strong> well, understand that that task was not finished because it was not a priority</p>
